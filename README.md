# Chepy


![Solving a CTF with Chepy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/securisec/chepy/master/docs/assets/ctf.gif)

Chepy is a python library with a handy cli that is aimed to mirror some of the capabilities of [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/). A reasonable amount of effort was put behind Chepy to make it compatible to the various functionalities that CyberChef offers, all in a pure Pythonic manner. There are some key advantages and disadvantages that Chepy has over Cyberchef. The Cyberchef concept of _stacking_ different modules is kept alive in Chepy.

There is still a long way to go for Chepy as it does not offer every single ability of Cyberchef.

## Feel free to give the project a ⭐️!

## Docs
[Refer to the docs for full usage information](http://chepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Example
[For all usage and examples, see the docs.](http://chepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Chepy has a stacking mechanism similar to Cyberchef. For example, this in Cyberchef:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/securisec/chepy/master/docs/assets/cc_encoding.png" width=400px>

This is equivalent to 

```python
from chepy import Chepy

file_path = "/tmp/demo/encoding"

print(
    Chepy(file_path)
    .load_file()
    .reverse()
    .rot_13()
    .base64_decode()
    .base32_decode()
    .hexdump_to_str()
    .o
)

```

## Chepy vs Cyberchef

#### Advantages
- Chepy is pure python with a supporting and accessible python api
- Chepy has a CLI
- Chepy CLI has full autocompletion.
- Supports pe, elf, and other various file format specific parsing.  
- Extendable via [plugins](https://chepy-plugins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Infinitely scalable as it can leverage the full Python library.
- Chepy can interface with the full Cyberchef web app to a certain degree. It is easy to move from Chepy to Cyberchef if need be. 
- The Chepy [python library](https://www.scaler.com/topics/python-libraries/) is significantly faster than the Cyberchef Node library.
- Works with HTTP/S requests without CORS issues.

#### Disadvantages
- Chepy is not a web app (at least for now).
- Chepy does not offer every single thing that Cyberchef does
- Chepy does not have the `magic` method (at the moment)


## Installation
Chepy can be installed in a few ways.

### Pypi
```bash
pip3 install chepy
# optionally with extra requirements
pip3 install chepy[extras]
```

### Git
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/securisec/chepy.git
cd chepy
pip3 install -e .
# I use -e here so that if I update later with git pull, I dont have it install it again (unless dependencies have changed)
```

#### [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/securisec/chepy)
```bash
docker run --rm -ti -v $PWD:/data securisec/chepy "some string" [somefile, "another string"]
```

#### Standalone binary
One can build Chepy to be a standalone binary also. This includes packaging all the dependencies together.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/securisec/chepy.git
cd chepy
pip install .
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller cli.py --name chepy --onefile
```
The binary will be in the dist/ folder.
